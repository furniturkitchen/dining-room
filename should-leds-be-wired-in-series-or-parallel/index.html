Plastic Crack How to light up your tanks! From plasticcrack.blogspot.com
The requirements of a lighting application often dictate what type of circuit can be used, but if given the choice, the most efficient way to run high power. In that case, brake it into two. You use the maximum wattage of the recessed fixture, it&#39;s listed inside the can. Unlike a series circuit, a parallel circuit receives the same voltage to each led, and the total current to each led is the total current output of the driver.
